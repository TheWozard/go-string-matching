# Go String Matching
A learning experience for efficient string processing and golang compiler optimization. The goal of which is to create a phrase matcher for situations like.
```
Match the word "park" but not "no park", "no   park", "no-park", or "parking".
```
This include multiple levels of insensitivity. The ability to ignore case, fixed spacing size, and ignoring special characters.
